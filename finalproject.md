## Interactive: the 2018 Midterm Elections
### The US House of Representatives 

WASHINGTON – The race for the United States House of Representatives is heating up as battleground districts are determined in an election cycle that is projected to be a blue wave influenced by constituent opinion of President Donald Trump.
 
Twenty-eight Republican and 10 Democrat members of congress will not seek re-election for various reasons, from declining health to inability to work with a president they view as divisive or a dysfunctional Congress, to a sexual harassment allegations that broke out of the Me Too movement and a possible bid for the presidency in 2020. 
 
Here are some elections to watch:
 
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Wisc. - 1st Congressional District, a Republican announced he will not seek re-election in April. Democrats are hopeful they’ll be able to gain his seat in the midterms even though Trump won the district with 52.6 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 42.3 percent of the vote in 2016.
 
Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock will face steep competition as six qualified candidates line up to face the 10th District member of Congress in an area that is leaning slightly to the left. The Democratic contenders include two employees of the State Department under Obama, a doctor, a veteran, a former federal prosecutor and a state representative. 
 
According to Elliott Morris, a graduate of the University of Texas who studied government history and computer science and data journalist with the Economist Magazine, Comstock has 36 percent chance of winning re-election. 
 
Comstock won the district with 52 percent of the vote in 2016 while Clinton carried the state of Virginia with a 5.4 percent margin over Trump. 
 
“Comstock has been good enough to hold onto her seat,” in what he called a Democratic district in previous elections said Morris at the end of April. “This year we’re facing a cycle where Democrats are, as of today, projected to win nationally by about 9 percentage points so we think that Comstock would lose her seat.”
 
Two New Jersey and one Arizona Republican members of congress could lose their seats as their districts begin to tilt in favor of Democrats. Martha McSally of Arizona’s 2nd Congressional District as well as Frank LoBiondo and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey’s 2nd Congressional District and 11th Congressional District respectively are in trouble. 
 
Clinton won New Jersey with 55 percent to the vote to Trump’s 41 percent of the vote, and Democrat Phil Murphy claimed the state governorship with 55 percent of the vote in November. Trump won Arizona with less than half of the states vote in 2016, Debbie Lesko won in the state’s very red 8th Congressional District with only 5 percentage points in an area that typically votes Republican with margins much wider than that, [according to FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/arizona-8-special-election-result/). 
 
In order for the House to flip from red to blue, Democrats will need to maintain control over the seats they have now, and gain 24 seats currently held by Republicans. Democrats are focusing efforts on 25 seats that are held by Republicans in districts that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/26/us/elections/house-races-midterms.html). 
 
The probability that Democrats take back the House was 55 - 56 percent according to Morris’ model at the end of April. But, he said the election is toss up on a national level and is built upon the idea that the national environment is indicative of every election at the district level. 
 
“If our polling is wrong, if the special elections are wrong - and there’s a chance that will happen, this is a probabilistic prediction - than the predictions at the district level have to be wrong,” Morris said.
 
As of last week, Trump’s national approval rating decreased to 40 percent from 42 percent, which is lower than last year’s 41 percent approval rating, according to Gallup.
