## Midterm Elections 2018
### The Battle for the House

WASHINGTON – The race for the United States House of Representatives is heating up as battleground districts are determined in an election cycle influenced by constituent opinion of President Donald Trump.
 
Twenty-eight Republicans and 10 Democrat members of congress will not seek re-election for various reasons, from declining health to inability to work with a president they view as divisive or a dysfunctional Congress, to a sexual harassment allegations that broke out of the Me Too movement and a possible bid for the presidency in 2020. 
 
Here are some elections to watch:
 
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican announced he will not seek re-election in April and Democrats are hopeful they’ll be able to gain his seat in the midterms even though Trump won the district in 2016.
 
Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock will face steep competition as six qualified candidates line up to face the 10th District member of Congress in an area that is leaning slightly to the left. The Democratic contenders include two employees of the State Department under Obama, a doctor, a veteran, a former federal prosecutor and a state representative. 
 
Two New Jersey and one Arizona Republican members of congress could lose their seats as their districts begin to tilt in favor of Democrats. Martha McSally of Arizona’s second congressional district as well as Frank LoBiondo and Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey’s second congressional district and 11th congressional district respectively are in trouble. 
 
In order for the House to flip from red to blue, Democrats will need to maintain control over the seats they have now, and gain 24 seats currently held by Republicans. Democrats are currently focusing efforts on 23 seats that are held by Republicans in districts that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016. 
 
As of last week, Trump’s national approval rating decreased to 40 percent from 42 percent, which is lower than last year’s 41 percent approval rating, according to Gallup.
