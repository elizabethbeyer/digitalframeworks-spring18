### Charts
I couldn't figure out how to download the chart from Google Sheets and upload it to Github in its interactive format, so here's a link to the finished, interactive chart. You can hover over each color block and the stats will pop up:

* I built this chart off of data that I pulled from Ballotpedia 
* It shows an interesting difference in the number of Republican v. Democrat representatives. You can see the major partisan differences between the two states with the most congressional districts.
* For example, you can clearly see which party is dominant in California: Democrats, and which is dominant in Texas: Republicans. 
* It's also interesting to see where the states with smaller populations stand. It looks like the small population coastal states lean Democrat, while the small popualtion states in the middle of the country lean Republican 
* This chart would accompany an interactive map, ideally, if it were published in a story. The map would show the breakdown of each congressional district with stats about incumbents and the upcoming election, once the reader hovers their mouse over the district.
